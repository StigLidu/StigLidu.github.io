    - title: Building Cooperative Embodied Agents Modularly with Large Language Models
      year: 2023
      description:
        - To appear at <b>NeurIPS 2023 FMDM Workshop</b>, <b>ICLR 2024</b> average score 6.5;
        - Authors&#58 Hongxin Zhang*, Weihua Du*, Jiaming Shan, Qinhong Zhou, Yilun Du, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Tianmin Shu, Chuang Gan.
        - Developing cooperative embodied agents, named CoELA, by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on communication and reasoning in multi-agent environments. By integrating LLMs like GPT-4, CoELA agents can communicate and cooperate effectively with both AI agents and humans, surpassing traditional planning-based methods.

    - title: Iteratively Learn Diverse Strategies with State Distance Information
      year: 2023
      description:
        - To appear at <b>NeurIPS 2023</b>.
        - Authors&#58 Wei Fu, Weihua Du, Jingwei Li, Sunli Chen, Jingzhao Zhang, Yi Wu.
        -  We developed a diversity-driven RL algorithm, State-based Intrinsic-reward Policy Optimization (SIPO). SIPO was tested across domains from robot locomotion to multi-agent games, consistently producing strategically diverse and human-interpretable policies that surpassed existing baselines

I’m a second-year Ph.D. student at [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/index.html), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I’m fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/) and [Prof. Sean Welleck](https://wellecks.com/). Before coming to CMU, I earned my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/Yao_Class/About_Yao_Class.htm)), where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/).

Along the way, I’ve been lucky to intern at several inspiring research labs: the [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) (with [Prof. Joshua B. Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and [Prof. Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/)), [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) (with [Dr. Kai Chen](https://chenkai.site/) and [Dr. Wenwei Zhang](https://zhangwenwei.cn/)), and [Seed](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/) (with [Dr. Jiecao Chen](https://jiecchen.github.io/)).

My long-term research interests center on **applying AI in the wild** — that is, moving beyond idealized experimental settings to ground AI systems in real-world scenarios, building technologies that assist people in everyday life ([[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02485)[[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01796)) and work ([[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15182)[[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02208)).

Recently, my research has focused on **LLM-based agents**, a promising direction that aligns closely with my interests, including improving robustness and capacity of agents ([[5]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17325)[[6]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05707)), designing effective inference-time algorithms ([[7]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05234)), and developing methods for long-context management towards complex tasks ([[8]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06727)).

Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy sports, especially volleyball 🏐, badminton 🏸, and running 🏃.

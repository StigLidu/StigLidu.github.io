I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. Student at [LTI](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/index.html), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) co-advised by [Prof. Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/) and [Prof. Sean Welleck](https://wellecks.com/). Before that, I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/)).

My research interests are centered on **LLM-Based Agents**, **Embodied AI and Robotics**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. I'm deeply intrigued by human cognitive development, which inspires my goal to develop a General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) agent. This agent would not only assimilate existing knowledge but also engage in self-directed, experiential learning.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I find joy in sports, especially volleyball, badminton, and running.

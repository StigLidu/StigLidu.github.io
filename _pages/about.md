I'm Weihua Du (杜伟桦), a first-year Ph.D. Student at [LTI](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/index.html), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) co-advised by [Prof. Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/) and [Prof. Sean Welleck](https://wellecks.com/). Before that, I completed my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/)).

My long-term research interests are centered on **LLM-Based Agents**, **Embodied AI**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. I am deeply intrigued by human cognitive development, which inspires my goal to develop a General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) agent. Currently, I am focus on **LLM inference strategies**.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I find joy in sports, especially volleyball, badminton, and running.

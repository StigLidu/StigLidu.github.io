I'm Weihua Du (杜伟桦), an incoming second-year Ph.D. student at [LTI](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/index.html), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), co-advised by [Prof. Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/) and [Prof. Sean Welleck](https://wellecks.com/). Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (also known as [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/)), where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/). Additionally, I had a wonderful internship at the MIT-IBM Lab, supervised by [Prof. Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/) at the junior year of undergraduate studies.

My long-term research interests center on **LLM-Based Agents**, **Embodied AI**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. I am deeply intrigued by human cognitive development, which inspires my goal of developing a General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) agent. Currently, I am focused on **LLM inference strategies**.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy sports, especially volleyball, badminton, and running.

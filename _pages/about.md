I'm currently a senior-year undergraduate student at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), directed by Andrew Chi-Chih Yao), majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

My research interest lies in Generative Agents, Embodied AI, and Reinforcement Learning.

I'm currently a senior-year undergraduate student at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), directed by [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)), majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

My research interests are centered on LLM-Based Agents, Embodied AI and Robotics, and Reinforcement Learning. I'm deeply intrigued by human cognitive development, which inspires my goal to develop a General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) agent. This agent would not only assimilate existing knowledge but also engage in self-directed, experiential learning.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I find joy in sports, especially volleyball and running. This blend of academic rigor and personal interests shapes my unique perspective.
